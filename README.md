=======

The first game I wrote on my commodore 64 when i was a kid... written from scratch in python to teach my son a little about software development.  This game is for educational purposes only, i will slowly be improving it when I find time, but feel free to report anything that isn't working.

NOTES
=====

This was developed in like 1 day so it isn't the best ;-)  Hopefully i'll get to improve it when working with the kids.

This has only been tested on ubuntu
